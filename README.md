# Simple Weather
 a simple weather app built with React

## Who is it for
This app was created for an application to a web development course, but could be useful as a real way to check a city's current daily forecast for a limited number of users (due to the 50 api calls per day constraint).

## How is it used
Simply type the name of any city in the world into the text field, then hit 'Enter' or click 'Search'. The city's weather results or an error message will appear.

Example screenshot:

## Future features
If development continues, the next update would let the user choose which city by that name they intended to find. For example, there are many cities named Cairo in the world, but the app currently only returns the highest ranked Cairo, in Egypt.
